          In 2017, I went to school for Media Studies at Trent Univeristy. There
          I studied Media under an interdiciplinary scope, touching on topic’s
          such as anthropology, sociology, computer science, marketing,
          advertising and design. In 2022 I decidced to take a leap, and delve
          into the parts of my degree that inspired me, which was web design and
          development.

            I’ve always been a creative, so the decision to pursue a more
            creative career was an easy one, although it was also a bit scary.
            Since then, I’ve dabbled in logo design and strengthening my design
            / art skills.

          I’m proud to say a logo I designed is now in use at my old elementary
          school. It’s an achievement I am thrilled about and it only drives me
          to see what else I am capable of. I continue to work on my SheCode
          workshops and strengthen my developer skills to hopefully one day
          establish a career in web design. To see more of my artsy stuff,

          When I’m not designing or working on my web developing skills, you can
          find me crocheting things for my friends, playing video games, or
          enjoying the beauty that Northern Ontario has to offer in my own
          backyard.
