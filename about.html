          I’m Makenah Dumont, a Canadian based Aspiring front end developer.
          Currently enrolled in SheCodes work shops to help get my foot in the
          door, I specialize in responsive web design and simple, usable UI/UX
          design.

          In 2017, I went to school for Media Studies at Trent Univeristy. There
          I studied Media under an interdiciplinary scope, touching on topic’s
          such as anthropology, sociology, computer science, marketing,
          advertising and design. Although I enjoyed my time at Trent, and
          learned a fair amount, I found myself graduated in 2021, still unsure
          on what to do with this knowledge. In 2022 I decidced to take a leap,
          and delve into the parts of my degree that inspired me, which was web
          design and development.

          I’ve always been a creative, so the decision to pursue a more creative
          career was an easy one, although it was also a bit scary. Since then,
          I’ve dabbled in logo design and strengthening my design / art skills
          and I’m proud to say a logo I designed is now in use at my old
          elementary school. It’s an achievement I am thrilled about and it only
          drives me to see what else I am capable of. I continue to work on my
          SheCode workshops and strengthen my developer skills to hopefully one
          day establish a career in web design. To see more of my artsy stuff,
          follow my Instagram!

          When I’m not designing or working on my web developing skills, you can
          find me crocheting things for my friends, playing video games, or
          enjoying the beauty that Northern Ontario has to offer in my own
          backyard.
